Hi 👋, I’m Sergio Hernández Domínguez, a programmer and data analyst who learns fast self-taught, adapts
and improvises easily. I am very good at working as a team, adapting to each working environment.

I’ve been programming since 2019 🖥️, being the language I’ve used most, Python. I have also worked 
with C/C++, Java, R, Bash,... I am constantly learning new computing tools, languages and disciplines. 💡️

I’m currently learning more Python tools to keep expanding my knowledge about the language. Soon I'll dive into
Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 🧠️

I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis 📊️ and data science projects. 👾️
